# Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree (LeetCode 297)
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Topics:** Tree, Design, DFS, BFS

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored or transmitted and later reconstructed.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format.

### Example 1
Input: `root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]`  
Output: `[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]`

### Example 2
Input: `root = []`  
Output: `[]`

### Constraints
- The number of nodes is in the range `[0, 10^4]`  
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
